<h1>Simulating axonal sprouting in the post-stroke cortex</h1>

This repository documents our final project for the course BT5420 - Introduction to Systems Biology, taught by Dr. Karthik Raman at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

Axonal sprouting is a process that involves the reinnervation of previously denervated muscle fibers by fine processes from intact axons. Large-scale, widespread axonal sprouting observed after a stroke is known to be an emergent property of brain networks. Brain networks provide information about the connections between anatomical brain regions through fiber tracts. These networks are also known to show properties of small-world networks and high robustness against node failures and targeted attacks. Here, we analyze five different neuron connectivity networks to understand their properties and robustness. These networks show small-world properties and are highly robust to both random failures and targeted attacks on ‘hub’ nodes. We then model the process of axonal sprouting in the post-stroke cortex, specifically in the macaque cerebral cortex network, to understand how the properties of the networks change after rewiring in the form of sprouting has taken place. 

We see that artificially inducing lesions affect many network properties. We simulate three different types of axonal sprouting to ‘repair’ this network. We see that large-scale, unbounded axonal sprouting can potentially aid in recovering some properties of the network. However, the small-world property of the cortical network, which is hypothesized to be crucial in its functioning as an integrator of information, is not recovered by this repair process. Our model of axonal sprouting points to a potential reason why strokes in the brain can be so devastating despite having this extensive repair mechanism.
